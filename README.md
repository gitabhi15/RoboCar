—This project is a basic autonomous robot car that can detect and avoid obstacles using an ultrasonic sensor mounted on a servo motor. As it moves forward, it continuously scans its path and makes real-time decisions to turn left or right when an obstacle is detected. It’s a great hands-on way to understand the fundamentals of robotics, motor control, and basic sensor-based automation.

—Features:

1. Detects obstacles using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor
2. Uses a servo to scan surroundings (optional but recommended)
3. Avoids collisions by automatically changing direction
4. Runs fully autonomously once powered on

—Hardware Used:

1. Arduino Uno
2. HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
3. L298N Motor Driver Module
4. 2 or 4 DC Motors + Chassis
5. Servo motor (for scanning)
6. Power supply (battery pack or USB)
7. Jumper wires, breadboard, etc.
